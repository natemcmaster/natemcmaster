### Hi there, I'm Nate 👋


I'm most known on GitHub for my contributions to the .NET project (https://github.com/dotnet) while working for Microsoft from 2015 to 2019. From 2019 to 2025, I worked for AWS but had very little open source work. What little I did was done under the [@mcmasn-amzn](https://github.com/mcmasn-amzn) account.

📫 How to reach me:
