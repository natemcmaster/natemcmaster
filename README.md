### Hi there, I'm Nate ðŸ‘‹

I started doing open source when I worked for Microsoft on the [.NET project](https://github.com/dotnet). I'm now working for AWS and don't have much time for open source, but when I do, I usually work on Python or C# projects.

This is my *personal* account. Starting in 2019, activity on this account is a reflection of work I am doing in my personal time. This account is **NOT** used for activity supported or approved by my employer.

For work I'm doing on behalf of my employer, see [@mcmasn-amzn](https://github.com/mcmasn-amzn).
